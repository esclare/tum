Reconhecidos como alegres, joviais, andarilhos, comedores, bebedores e namoradores desde a nossa estreia nas Monumentais Festas do Enterro da Gata de mil novecentos e noventa, temos sido com grande orgulho a grande Embaixatriz Académica da Universidade do Minho, levando a alegria e deixando a saudade por todas as terras e locais por onde já passámos. A Tuna Universitária do Minho enverga o trajo académico da Universidade do Minho, com pequenas alterações aprovadas pela praxe da academia minhota. Adoptou o uso de meias vermelhas, cor da Universidade do Minho, assim como um «bico» da mesma cor sobre os ombros, que já nos valeram a alcunha de «vermelhinhos», conferindo à Tuna uma identidade muito própria. Em homenagem às raízes da Academia Bracarense, a TUM com a colaboração do maestro Armindo Maia, antigo regente da Tuna do Liceu nacional Sá de Miranda, resgatou alguns dos hinos dessa tuna, alguns dos quais se tornariam também em nossos hinos.\nContinuando a tradição iniciada aquando da nossa fundação, todos os anos nos refugiamos nas serras da Peneda-Gerês, compondo e ensaiando em “retiros espirituais” inspirados nas belezas do parque natural. Agradecidos pelo apoio e reconhecimento com que os Bracarenses nos tem prestigiado, anualmente, abrimos o nosso festival com uma Serenata que dedicamos à Cidade de Braga, realizada no Largo do Paço, lugar emblemático e cenário de todas as cerimónias e iniciações. Anualmente organizamos o FITU Bracara Avgvsta – Festival Internacional de Tunas Universitárias que reúne, em Braga, cerca de 300 tunos, no mês de Maio, sendo já uma referência no panorama dos festivais de tunas, e também um dos maiores eventos culturais da cidade. Como Tuna mais antiga da academia minhota, temos a honra de ter como tunas afilhadas a Azeituna – Tuna de Ciências da Universidade do Minho, a Tuna Académica do Externato Infante D. Henrique, a Afonsina – Tuna de Engenharia da Universidade do Minho e a Tuna Académica da Universidade Fernando Pessoa. Desde Maio de 1993, a Tuna Universitária do Minho está irmanada com a Tuna de Direito de Oviedo, com a qual gravamos em dueto a música “Hermanamiento Minhedo” e desde Abril de 2001 com a Tuna de Medicina do Porto.\nIntegrados na ARCUM – Associação Recreativa e Cultural Universitária do Minho, temos, ao longo da sua história, percorrido, sozinhos ou com os restantes grupos da ARCUM, todo o território nacional, continental e insular, bem como alguns dos locais mais privilegiados do mundo por diferentes continentes. A Tuna Universitária do Minho comemorou em Maio de 2000 o seu décimo aniversário. Esta comemoração foi assinalada com o lançamento do C.D. duplo “Tuna Universitária do Minho” composto por 31 músicas que marcaram o percurso da Tuna desde a sua fundação.\n","permalink":"https://tum.pt/pages/historial/","tags":null,"title":"Historial"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
